useEffect -
1). It's an intentional feature of the StrictMode. This only happens in development, and helps find accidental side effects put into the render phase. We only do this for components with Hooks because those are more likely to accidentally have side effects in the wrong place. https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html
2). The difference is that if you don't provide the empty array dependency, 
the useEffect() hook will be executed on both mount and update;
more: 
- Giving it an empty array acts like componentDidMount as in, it only runs once.
- Giving it no second argument acts as both componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate, as in it runs first on mount and then on every re-render.
